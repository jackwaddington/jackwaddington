## Howdy 👋

Welcome to Github!

Here I am sharing some of my projects and the thoughts around them.

I'm interested in data and infrastructure - how we record, transmit, store, process and present data. Are we finding the rigth data? And if we think we are getting it - are we really?

## TL;DR

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Joint Account Analyser](https://github.com/jackwaddington/joint-account-analyser) as [PDF](https://github.com/jackwaddington/joint-account-analyser/blob/main/example_joint_account_report.pdf) | *Analyse Nordea .csv from a joint bank account and create a report. R, Python* |
| [Joint Account Analyser](https://github.com/jackwaddington/online_private_bank_statement_analyser) as [Web](https://jackwaddington.github.io/online_private_bank_statement_analyser/) | *As above but on Web technologies with mindblowing features. TypeScript, React* |
| [Smart Timelapse Pipeline](https://github.com/jackwaddington/smart-timelapse-pipeline) to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RoihuCam) | *Daily timelapse, from sunrise to sunset, uploaded automatically to YouTube  - from one device. Python, C++* |
| [Smart Timelapse Pipeline](https://github.com/jackwaddington/smart-timelapse-pipeline) to [under construction]  | *Containerising elements of the above to make magic. Python, Docker, K3S* |



## whoami

My name is [Jack Waddington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-waddington/) and I live in [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki).

My professional background is in Business & Administration, Visual Communication (Photography) and Operations Management.

Recently I completed my studies in Software Engineering at [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/), Helsinki. While I search for work I'm really excited to be able to build as many of my own projects as time allows.

My hobbies include swimming, parenting and going to [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=fi--helsinki&source=EVENTS&categoryId=-998).


## How I build

I like the idea of _'What problem are we trying to solve?'_.

I can then express this ontop of infrastructure, using Project Management to push them forward and testing to check they satisfy the solution.

- Infrastructure
  - [OpenBSD](https://github.com/jackwaddington/OpenBSD) — Router & firewall (Raspberry Pi 4)
  - [K3s](https://github.com/jackwaddington/k3s) — Kubernetes cluster (3 nodes)
  - [homelab-gitops](https://github.com/jackwaddington/homelab-gitops) — ArgoCD deployments
  - [jWorld-observability](https://github.com/jackwaddington/jWorld-observability) — Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
  - [Smart Timelapse Pipeline](https://github.com/jackwaddington/smart-timelapse-pipeline) — Pi 5 camera
  - [Pi0Cam](https://github.com/jackwaddington/Pi0Cam) — Pi Zero W timelapse camera
