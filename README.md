# Howdy 👋

While I seek employment this is a great time to get all these projects out of my head and into the 'IRL'!

I enjoy asking: how can we record, transmit, store, process, validate and present data? And why would we even do that?!

Most recently I've been blown away by:
- the power of modern computers (2025-> )
- text-based data analysis by machine
- text generation by a machine

I'm exploring these ideas with [Discord_Philosopher](https://github.com/jackwaddington/discord_philosopher) — creating data through autonomous LLM debate — and [Discord_Airflow](https://github.com/jackwaddington/discord_airflow) — to analyse.

Join me as I explore technologies through building my solutions!
