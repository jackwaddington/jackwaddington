# Howdy 👋

While I am seeking employment I am building out all the projects that have been in the back of my head throughout my studies.

My passion lies in asking: how can we record, transmit, store, process, validate and present data? And why would we even do that?!

Most recently I've been blown away by:
- the power of modern computers (2025->)
- text-based data being analysed by a machine
- text being generated by a machine

I have done such tasks manually, and studied photography - so may I be so bold as to suggest this is the new camera - it liberates us to make more pictures quicker, or the dishwasher that liberates us to do more work.

I'm exploring these with [discord-philosopher](https://github.com/jackwaddington/discord_philosopher) — creating data through autonomous LLM debate — and [discord-intelligence](https://github.com/jackwaddington/discord_intelligence) — analysing it.

And aswith the dawn of photography - the ethical debates are fascinating. Aswith 3D printing - a little scary.

Please find below more of my solutions as I explore technologies:
