## Howdy 👋

I find myself drawn to data and infrastructure - how we record, transmit, store, process and present data. Are we finding the right data? And if we think we are - are we really and are you sure?

In practice, that means networking, observability, pipelines and visualisation — and the testing to trust them.

## TL;DR

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Joint Account Analyser](https://github.com/jackwaddington/joint-account-analyser) as [PDF](https://github.com/jackwaddington/joint-account-analyser/blob/main/example_joint_account_report.pdf) | *Analyse Nordea .csv from a joint bank account and create a report. R, Python* |
| [Joint Account Analyser](https://github.com/jackwaddington/online_private_bank_statement_analyser) as [Web](https://jackwaddington.github.io/online_private_bank_statement_analyser/) | *As above but on Web technologies with mindblowing features. TypeScript, React* |
| [Smart Timelapse Pipeline](https://github.com/jackwaddington/smart-timelapse-pipeline) to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@RoihuCam) | *Daily timelapse, from sunrise to sunset, uploaded automatically to YouTube  - from one device. Python, C++* |
| [Smart Timelapse Pipeline](https://github.com/jackwaddington/smart-timelapse-pipeline) to [under construction]  | *Containerising elements of the above to make magic. Python, Docker, K3S* |



## whoami

My name is [Jack Waddington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-waddington/) and I live in [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki).

I studied Visual Communication at [Edinburgh College of Art](https://www.eca.ed.ac.uk/) under [David Williams](https://www.youtube.com/@all-in-all1746/videos) - where I learned that the medium serves the message. What matters is what we're trying to communicate, not the tool we use to do it.

That thinking carried through many years in operations management, where I built reporting systems, deployed POS infrastructure, and learned that getting the right data to the right people is what makes good decisions possible.

Recently I completed my studies in Software Engineering at [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/), Helsinki. As a medium, code has the ability to express complicated logic.


## How I build

_'What problem are we trying to solve?'_

That question comes from art school, but it works everywhere. I build on top of infrastructure, use project management to push things forward, and testing to check they satisfy the solution.

- Infrastructure
  - [OpenBSD](https://github.com/jackwaddington/OpenBSD) — Router & firewall (Raspberry Pi 4)
  - [K3s](https://github.com/jackwaddington/k3s) — Kubernetes cluster (3 nodes)
  - [Pi0Cam](https://github.com/jackwaddington/Pi0Cam) — Pi Zero W timelapse camera
- DevOps
  - [homelab-gitops](https://github.com/jackwaddington/homelab-gitops) — ArgoCD deployments
  - [jWorld-observability](https://github.com/jackwaddington/jWorld-observability) — Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
