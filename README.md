## Howdy 👋

Welcome to my hand-crafted, artisanal Github! Here I can show my solutions and share a how I built them.

I am interested in data - how we record it, store it, process it and present it. And is a piece of data even relevant?!

I am intersted in the infrastruture to perform this - network, storage, how it is transmitted, recorded, visualised and is it even working?!


## whoami

My name is [Jack Waddington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-waddington/) and I live in [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki). My background is in Business & Administration, Photography and Operations Management.

Recently I completed my studies in Software Engineering at [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/), Helsinki and while I am job searching I'm really excited to be able to be able to build as many of my own projects that time allows.

My hobbies are swimming, computing and going to [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/find/?ocation=fi--helsinki&source=EVENTS&categoryId=-998).


## How I build
