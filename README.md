## Howdy 👋

Welcome to my hand-crafted, artisanal Github! Here I can show my solutions and share how I built them.

I'm interested in data and infrastructure - how we record, store, process and present information, and whether it's even relevant. I'm equally fascinated by the systems that make this possible: networks, storage, transmission, visualisation, and monitoring.


## whoami

My name is [Jack Waddington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-waddington/) and I live in [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki). My background is in Business & Administration, Photography and Operations Management.

Recently I completed my studies in Software Engineering at [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/), Helsinki and while I am job searching I'm really excited to be able to build as many of my own projects as time allows.

My hobbies are swimming, computing and going to [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=fi--helsinki&source=EVENTS&categoryId=-998).


## How I build

We build projects on top of infrastructure, using Project Management to push them forward and then test they satisfy the project 'brief'.
