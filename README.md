## Howdy 👋

Welcome to my hand-crafted, artisanal Github.

I am interested in data - how we record it, store it, process it and present it. And is a piece of data even relevant?!

I am interested by the whole infrastructure to perform this - the network, the storage, how it is transittied, how it is recorded and how it is visualised.
