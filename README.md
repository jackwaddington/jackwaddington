# Howdy 👋

Currently seeking employment — and while I am, I'm building out all the projects that have been in the back of my head throughout my studies.

My passion lies in asking: how can we record, transmit, store, process, validate and present data?

Most recently I've been blown away by:
- the raw power of modern computers
- the capability of LLMs
- text-based data being analysed by a machine
- text being generated by a machine

I'm exploring these with [discord-philosopher](https://github.com/jackwaddington/discord_philosopher) — creating data through autonomous LLM debate — and [discord-intelligence](https://github.com/jackwaddington/discord_intelligence) — analysing it.

Please also find more of my solutions below as I explore technologies.
