## Howdy 👋

Welcome to my hand-crafted, artisanal Github!

Here I would like to share some of my projects and how I built them.

I'm interested in data and infrastructure - how we record, transmit, store, process and present information. And to check that we are infact recording that information, did we actually store it & etc with observability.


## whoami

My name is [Jack Waddington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-waddington/) and I live in [Helsinki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki).

My professional background is in Business & Administration, Visual Communication (Photography) and Operations Management.

I recently completed my studies in Software Engineering at [Hive](https://www.hive.fi/), Helsinki. While I search for work I'm really excited to be able to build as many of my own projects as time allows.

My hobbies are swimming, parenting and going to [Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/find/?location=fi--helsinki&source=EVENTS&categoryId=-998).


## How I build

I like the idea of _'What problem are we trying to solve?'_. This helps me to know when something is done.

My solutions are built on top of infrastructure, using Project Management to push them forward and then test they satisfy the project 'brief'.
