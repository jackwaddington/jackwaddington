## Howdy 👋

I find myself drawn to data and infrastructure - how we record, transmit, store, process, validate and present data.

I enjoy revisiting the question _'What problem are we trying to solve?'_

To make a solution IMHO we probably need:
- infrastructure to build on top of
-  project management to push things forward
-  something DevOps to do the building
-  testing to check the solution is satifsfied 
-  observability to check the lights are on.

Here I am happy to share some of my....
